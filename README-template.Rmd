## Repository Structure and Reproducibility

<!-- Modify this appropriate if you change project structure -->

-   `data/` contains data from the study
    and a data dictionary describing all variables.
-   `R/` contains functions used in this analysis. 
-   `reports/` contains literate code for  R Markdown reports generated in the analysis
-   `outputs/` contains compiled reports and figures.
-   This project uses the [{targets}](https://wlandau.github.io/targets-manual/) 
    framework to organize build steps for analysis pipeline.  The steps are
    defined in the `_targets.R` file and the workflow can be executed by running
    `run.R` via `source("run.R")` in your R terminal or `Rscript run.R` in 
    your system shell.  The schematic figure below summarizes the steps. (The figure is generated using
    `mermaid.js` syntax and should display as a graph on GitHub.  It can also
    be viewed by pasting the code into <https://mermaid.live>.)

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, results='asis'}
tar_load(plan_targets)
mer <- targets::tar_mermaid(targets_only = TRUE, outdated = FALSE, 
                            legend = FALSE, color = FALSE, 
                            exclude = c("readme", ends_with("_targets")))
cat(
  "```mermaid",
  mer[1], 
  #'Objects([""Objects""]) --- Functions>""Functions""]',
  'subgraph Project Workflow',
  mer[3:length(mer)],
  'linkStyle 0 stroke-width:0px;',
  "```",
  sep = "\n"
)
```

-   This project requires `r R.version$version.string`. This project uses the [{renv}](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) framework to 
    record R package dependencies and versions. Packages and versions used are recorded in 
    `renv.lock` and code used to manage dependencies is in `renv/` and other files
    in the root project directory.  On starting an R session in the working directory, run `renv::restore()`
    to install R package dependencies.
